# Introduction: asmFishCP
This is a branch that contains extra (non-chronological) patches in order to keep asmFish
as competitive as possible. Due to the tedious nature of upkeeping assembly code, it is 
often the case that asmFish lags behind SF Dev by several months. This branch 
aims to compensate for this lag by providing immediate access to critical and/or easily 
portable patches. 

# What version of SF does this branch correspond to?
Because patches are often applied in a non-chronological fashion, all releases also include
a recompiled version of Stockfish, located in the "benchMatch" folder. For versions of asmFish 
that correspond to previous versions of official SF-releases, please refer to [lantonov/asmFish](https://github.com/lantonov/asmFish),
which I will also try to update as often as possible.
